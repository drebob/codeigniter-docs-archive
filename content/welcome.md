# Welcome to CodeIgniter4

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure. It is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries.

CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

Where possible, CodeIgniter has been kept as flexible as possible, allowing you to work in the way you want, not being forced into working any certain way. The framework can have core parts easily extended or completely replaced to make the system work the way you need it to.
